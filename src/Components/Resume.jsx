          My name is Jhonier CÃ³rdoba and I am deeply interested in learning
          about web development and artificial intelligence. I consider myself a
          very responsible person, a fast learner and a good teamplayer. Right
          now I want to acquire solid knowledge as a developer and start working
          at a company with good enviroment.
